# `basic-binding`

This library is a simple and generic [graphql-binding](https://github.com/graphql-binding/graphql-binding) implementation which should be suitable for connecting to most GraphQL server that don't require any kind of authorisation.

## Overview

$ yarn add basic-binding
# or:
$ npm install basic-binding
```

## How to use

More documentation to come, but in the meantime, please refer to the examples in this repository.
